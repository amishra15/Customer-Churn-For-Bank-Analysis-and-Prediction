Methodology:

Model Development and Accuracy:
Employed Gradient Boosting, a machine learning algorithm, achieving a notable accuracy rate of 87% in predicting customer churn.
Ensured the model's robustness by actively mitigating overfitting concerns during the training and evaluation phases.

Identification of Churn Factors:
Investigated and established connections between specific factors and customer churn rates.
Highlighted correlations between lower account balances, reduced credit scores, and increased instances of customer churn.

Insights into Churn Dynamics:
Conducted in-depth analysis to unveil how customer attributes such as age, gender, credit scores, and account balances impact churn rates.
Provided comprehensive insights into the relationship between these variables and the likelihood of customers churning.

Integration of Analytical and ML Approaches:
Merged analytical methodologies with machine learning techniques to gain a holistic understanding of customer churn.
Leveraged both statistical analysis and predictive modeling to create a more nuanced perspective on churn dynamics.

Achievements and Results:
High Prediction Accuracy: Achieved an impressive 87% accuracy in predicting customer churn using Gradient Boosting.
Identification of Churn Factors: Established links between lower account balances, reduced credit scores, and increased churn rates.
Insightful Analysis: Uncovered detailed insights into how customer demographics and financial behaviors influence the likelihood of churn.

Conclusion:
The "Customer Churn For Bank | Analysis and Prediction" project successfully combined machine learning models, analytical techniques, and data insights to predict and understand customer churn within a banking context. The achieved accuracy with Gradient Boosting, alongside the identification of factors such as account balances and credit scores impacting churn rates, provides valuable insights for proactive retention strategies.
